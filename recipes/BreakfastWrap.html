        <li>¼ cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese</li>

        <li>1 slice turkey bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ ounce marinated artichoke hearts, drained and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 (10 inch) flour tortilla/li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Whisk eggs and sour cream together in a bowl until well blended; stir in Cheddar cheese.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Add onion and pesto; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 
            about 6 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, then pour egg mixture over top. Cook and stir until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove eggs from the skillet.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Add turkey bacon to the skillet; cook and stir until starting to crisp, about 6 minutes. Add artichoke hearts; sauté until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove bacon and artichokes from the skillet.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Spray the skillet again with cooking spray. Place tortilla into the skillet; cook until warm and flexible, 30 to 60 seconds per side. Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>Spoon egg mixture, bacon, and artichokes into the center of the tortilla; season with salt and pepper. Fold the bottom 2 inches of the tortilla up to enclose the filling, and wrap tightly.</p>
    </ol>

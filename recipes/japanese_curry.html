    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. 
        It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people.

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. 
            Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.
